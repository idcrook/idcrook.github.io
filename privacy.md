## How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll, Google Analytics, and Disqus and is hosted on GitHub. Github (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, we have taken actions to mitigate some aspects of their tracking. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses.

<!-- uses TLS. agreed to a Data Processing Amendment -->


### Disqus
