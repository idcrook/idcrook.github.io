## How your data is processed

This website is powered by Jekyll, Google Analytics, and Disqus and is hosted on GitHub. Github (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. However, actions have been taken to mitigate some aspects of tracking. Google Analytics has been configured to anonymize IP addresses.

<!-- ALSO: Use TLS. Agreed to a Data Processing Amendment -->

### Disqus

This website uses Discus for comments. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts, and the comments have been enabled for a particular page.  Site Admin Settings for this website has turned *OFF* the following:

- [ ] &nbsp; Tracking - Enable anonymous cookie targeting for your site's visitors.
- [ ] &nbsp; Affiliate links - Automatically append merchant codes to product links on your site.
