### 14-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Pro, 2023)

The MacBook Pro models for 2023 have been updated with M2-series processors. They squeeze in bigger displays compared to M1 versions. They manage to keep basically identical footprints though. Thinner bezels!

### 13-inch MacBook Pro (2015)

The MacBook Pro models from 2015 have become a collector's item since they were prior to the "Touch Bar" and re-designed key switches keyboard found starting in 2016 models that started a dark ages for many MacBook Pro-s users.

### 13-inch MacBook Air (2010)

The trend-setting 2010 MacBook Air had quite a large bezel around its non-Retina screen, which adds to its chassis dimensions when compared to recent models in the same size class. It was also even thicker, likely due to the packaging and thermal solutions required for its novel (at the time) thinner-package Intel processors.
