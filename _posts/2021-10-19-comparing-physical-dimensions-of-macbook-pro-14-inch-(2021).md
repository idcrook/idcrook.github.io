|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 13-inch MacBook Air (2010)       | 0.68 (1.7 cm)      | 12.8 (32.5 cm)       | 8.94 (22.7 cm)      | 2.9 lbs (1.32 kg)      |
| 13-inch MacBook Pro (Early 2015) | 0.71 (1.8 cm)      | **12.53 (31.4 cm)**  | **8.62 (21.9 cm)**  | **3.48 lbs (1.58 kg)** |
| 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020)   | **0.61 (1.56 cm)** | 11.97 (30.41 cm)     | 8.36 (21.24 cm)     | 3.0 lbs (1.4 kg)       |
| **14-inch MacBook Pro (2021)**   | **0.61 (1.55 cm)** | **12.31 (31.26 cm)** | **8.71 (22.12 cm)** | **3.5 lb (1.6 kg)**    |

Table comparing dimensions with closest matching to new 14-inch MacBook Pro **bolded**.

The *nearest model in the comparisons by overall size and weight* is the **2015 13-inch MacBook Pro**, and the new 14-inch model is 2.5 mm *thinner* ("Height" in table) than it. In fact the listed *Height* (laptop thickness), *Width* (chassis along display width) and *Depth* (chassis along display height) for the 2015 MBP are all within 2.5 mm differences, which is less than a tenth of an inch.

Many cases or sleeves or backpacks that could accomodate a 2015-era 13-inch MBP should handle the new 2021 14-inch MBP without any issues.

The new 2021 14-inch model manages to fit its Liquid Retina display that is larger diagonally by almost a full inch (0.9 inch) into a chassis that is similar in size to older *13-inch* models. Have you heard the good news of **"The Notch"**?

Model Comparisons to new 14-inch MacBook Pro
--------------------------------------------

### 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 2020)

The M1 13-inch MacBook Pro from 2020 is as thin as the new 14-inch model, but its smaller overall display width allows its chassis to be 8.5 mm less wide vs. the 14-inch model.

### 13-inch MacBook Pro (2015)

The MacBook Pro models from 2015 have become a collector's item since they were prior to the "Touch Bar" and re-designed key switches keyboard in 2016 that started a dark ages for many users of MacBook Pro-s. As it happens, its chassis is about the same size and weight of the new 2021 14-inch MacBook Pro.

### 13-inch MacBook Air (2010)

The trend-setting 2010 MacBook Air had quite a large bezel around its non-Retina screen, which adds to its chassis dimensions when compared to recent models in the same size class. It was even thicker, likely due to the packaging and thermal solutions required for its novel (at the time) thinner-package Intel processors.

16-inch MacBook Pro (2021) versus 17-inch MacBook Pro (Early 2008)
------------------------------------------------------------------

As a curious point of reference, there were once 17-inch MacBook Pro-s sold. And their feet were visible in product shots. One of its display options "17-inch (diagonal) antiglare TFT widescreen LED backlit display with support for millions of colors" with supported resolutions: "1920 by 1200 (native)".

| Dimension                         | Height             | Width                 | Depth                 | Weight               | Display   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2008) | 1.0 inch (2.59 cm) | 15.4 inches (39.2 cm) | 10.4 inches (26.5 cm) | 6.8 pounds (3.08 kg) | 17.0 inch |
| MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)       | 0.66 (1.68 cm)     | 14.01 (35.57 cm)      | 9.77 (24.81 cm)       | 4.7 lbs (2.1 kg)     | 16.2 inch |

So the new 16-inch MacBook Pro's display comes within 0.8 inch of the thirteen-years older 17-inch MacBook Pro's display, but it trims off 2.1 pounds (almost 1.0 kg) weight -- over 30%.

And it's >30% thinner.

And it's over a whole inch less wide along the display width, and over half-an-inch less tall along the display height.
